    "# Optimising speech recognition dataset partitions utilising linear programming\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditionally speech datasets split into training, development and test sets are generally constrained by:\n",
    "* Ensuring there is no overlap of speakers across the sets, i.e. that the speakers are unique within each partition.\n",
    "* The duration of the training, development and test sets are rougly 80%, 10%, 10% respectively.\n",
    "* Finally, if possible, ensuring that there is an equal balance between male and female speakers in the sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, partitioning the corpus under investigation is complicated by the diverse variety of language combinations utttered by each speaker.\n",
    "Our considered dataset consists of 50 hours of code-switched speech in eight Southern African languages (English, isiZulu, isiXhosa, Sesotho, Setswana, Sepedi, Tsotsitaal, and Afrikaans) from 307 different speakers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Intrasentential code-switching, which is the use of multiple languages within sentences, is a common occurance in this dataset.\n",
    "Because the primary focus of our dataset is to evaluate speech recognition systems on code-switched speech, this data should be fairly represented in the test partition.\n",
    "However, partitioning the corpus under investigation is complicated by the diverse variety of language combinations uttered by each speaker.\n",
    "In total, 94 different combinations of one, two, three or even four of the the eight languages present in the dataset were observed in single utterances.\n",
    "Additionally, we observe that a large proportion of the speakers produce solely monolingual speech, while utterances by other speakers are a mix of code-switched and monolingual speech.\n",
    "\n",
    "Partitioning this dataset is a complex combinatorial problem because 307 speakers can be assigned to three different partitions in $3^{307} - 3 \\cdot 2 ^{307} + 3$ different arrangements ([solution](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/527216/distributing-n-different-things-among-r-distinct-groups-such-that-all-of-the)).\n",
    "\n",
    "### We begin by loading in the dataset:\n",
    "* Again, our dataset consists of speech in eight languages where up to four languages are used in intra-sentential code-switching and consists of 307 speakers.\n",
    "* As evidenced in the dataframe, 94 distinct combinations of languages are present within utterances."

    "This problem can be described as allocating $N_r$ resources or tasks ($r$) to $N_W$ workers ($w$) given a set of constraints. A cost matrix $\\boldsymbol{C}$ of dimensionality $(N_w,N_r)$ defines a cost $c_{i,j}$ of assigning a worker $i$ to a specific resource $j$.

    "  <li>Speakers who contribute a large amount of monolingual speech or large amount of code-switched speech should be prioritised for assignment to the training set or the test set respectively.</li>\n",
